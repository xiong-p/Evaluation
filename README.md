# SCOPF surragate 
1. generate the scenario data
2. evaluate the solutions to generate the training data for the approximation network

The evaluation of the solutions is done by the `evaluate.py` and `data.py` script. The script is based on https://github.com/GOCompetition/Evaluation.git

The structure of the code
- src
    - generate_data.py # generate the scenario data
    - random_load_profile.py # generate the random load profile
    - generate_data_parallel.py and scenario_operations.py # used to generate the scenario data in parallel
    - get_stage2_pen.py # gather the second stage penalty from each detail file, and splitting the data for training the approximation neural network.
    - generate_result.py # generate solving time and solution results into the the ./result folder
- model
    folder to store the trained model weights
- result
    - store the result csv files
    - result.ipynb and time_result.ipynb # generate the result table and plots
- load_model.py # load the trained model and write the weights of the neural network in to txt files in the model folder
- test.py, test.sh # the function to call the evalutation.run method to evaluate the solutions
- examples
    - case2 # an example datafile
